# Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Teaching Facility

The CGRB has hosted infrastructure for teaching purposes for several years. This continues to grow into the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Teaching Facility (ACTF). On top of this system we have developed Docker-based containers, providing:

    Web-based command-line access
    Access to the full suite of CGRB-curated bioinformatics software, as well as custom scripts and installs
    upyter notebooks for instruction in Python, C, and other languages
    RStudio for R-based instruction

The containers and authentication methods together provide:

    Dynamic, adjustable, and per-class resource allocation (CPU, IO, RAM, disk)
    Per-class instructor and student groups
    Data persistence (for homeworks, grading, sharing of code, documents and data.)
